Here's a project I wanted to do for a long time. It's a laptop with the screen modded to turn 180 degrees.

Here's the first version:

Closeup from the front. I screwed an aluminium plate to the plastic to hold the whole thing.

A closeup of the screen, closed. I used an aluminium block that I screwed in the plastic behind the lcd. I made a ball joint from an aluminium block and an parts from a cheap tripod.

The whole thing is not very elegent, and it doesn't work as well as I expected, but it was still very fun to do.
