Somewhere through the years I picked up a No 50 Blasting machine that one of my employers was throwing away. Yep, its the real deal. Who did I work for? Thats not important right now. What is important is that this fine antique is all fixed up and hooked to an Arduino to make a party game. Here's before and after plus the score from the last Fouparty. Come to the next one and beat Bartek.
