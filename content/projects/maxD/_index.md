MaxD is a supermedia audio/visual artist whos work has never been in a legit gallery. He thrives on tinkering with junk, plumbing materials, electronics and computers, but not projectors. In 2008 he co-founded Foulab and is now hacking away at a BFA in Inter Media Cyber Arts at Concordia University.
