Everyone needs a few kilovolts now and then. Using a flyback transformer or an automotive coil it is possible to build a moderately high voltage supply. Several interesting projects can be done with this, including ionic lifters, Kirlian photography and alpha particle detection, not to mention big fancy sparks.

[I've done some work on this in the past](http://strawprojects.blogspot.ca/2011/10/high-voltage-supply-some-progress.html) with a trivially simple circuit, but when it came time to actually use the high voltage in projects, it wasn't up to the job. Time to take it to the next level.  
Cost: Free, although pass-the-hat style donations to support the lab are encouraged.

On __Work In Progress Night__ a foulaber brings a work in progress to the lab and works on it for a few hours. Anyone interested can drop in to check it out and discuss the project, receive or give advice, or bring a similar project and work on it. There is no promise that anything will actually work, but it should be fun!!!
