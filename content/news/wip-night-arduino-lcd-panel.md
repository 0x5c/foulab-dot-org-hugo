Gapzap recently scored some righteous looking lcd panels. It would be cool to include them as part of an Arduino workshop. However, we first have to figure out how they work. Time permitting, may also work on a few other Arduino related items, e.g. bootloader flashing. If you have Arduino projects, drop on down.

Cost: Free, although pass-the-hat style donations to support the lab are encouraged.

On __Work In Progress Night__ a foulaber brings a work in progress to the lab and works on it for a few hours. Anyone interested can drop in to check it out and discuss the project, receive or give advice, or bring a similar project and work on it. There is no promise that anything will actually work, but it should be fun!!!
