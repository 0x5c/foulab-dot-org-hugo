This Saturday June 27th at 18h join us at Foulab in retro life with a view of BBS The Documentary. The series in eight episodes explores the world of the BBS all the way to it's replacement by the internet. As an example of technological autonomy BBSs were crafted, operated, and moderated by the community for the community. They faced repression from the state and capital and prevailed in the pursuit of fun and profit. The practice of BBBs is in stark contrast with today's commercial social media monopolies who sell users' data on the market and provide it on request to the state.
