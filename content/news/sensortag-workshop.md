IoT is one of the catchy technologies of this year, but it's not perfect.  Synchronizing with third parties and sharing very useful data with any marketing company doesn't appeal to everyone.  Luckily, a parallell industry of DIY IoT devices is running smoothly, and we'd like to help you explore it.  This work shop features the latest TI-SensorTag.  Workshop fees include one of these impressive boards.  The first project we'll be doing with this board is a weather station.  Pair the weather station over BluetoothLE with your iPhone or android device and get local readouts of air pressure, humidity and temperature.  Future workshops using the same device are in the works, so get a head start!  
  
WHEN:March 26th, 10AM onwards, until you have a weather station
