This week there are a bunch of new Arduino sensors to try out - temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Plus, we may try to build a couple custom ones.  
  
Cost: Free, although pass-the-hat style donations to support the lab are encouraged.  
  
Wednesday Dec. 4, 18:30-22:00  
  
On __Work In Progress Night__ a foulaber will bring a work in progress to the lab and work on it for a few hours. Anyone interested can drop in to check it out and discuss the project, receive or give advice, or bring a similar project and work on it. There is no promise that anything will actually work, but it should be fun!!!
