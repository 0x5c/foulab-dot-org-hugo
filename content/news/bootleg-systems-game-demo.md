Tuesday, March 29th starting at 9:00PM, Gabriel De Roy will be comming in to play test [Bootleg Systems](http://www.bootlegsystems.com/), a first person retro-sci-fi-puzzle-platformer. Do you like neon? Do you like synth pop? Do you like weaponized 3D fax machines of the future? This may be your kinda game. Come hang out, play the demo, and discuss your favourite 80's sci-fi.
