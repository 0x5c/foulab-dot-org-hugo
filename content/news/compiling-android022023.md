Android updates for any phone that isn't a flag-ship phone is patchy at best these days.  Between that and a world of benefits for those who customize android, compiling android is a useful skill.  We'll be going over some of the basics next Thursday (the 2nd) around 8pm EST.

Since the files involved are massive, and the build times are long, we recomend a bit of prep work: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/blueline/build Getting to the stage where you have downloaded the source code is a good idea.

Workshop is free, however donations are welcome.
