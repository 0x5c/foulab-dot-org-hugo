It's time for another brew day! This Saturday! All welcome, from experienced brewing enthusiasts to complete beginners! We'll be doing an easy kit brew as well as kombucha! Bring a few dollars to cover material costs and you can go home with your own mason jar of kombucha (which can work as starting material for your own brew!).

We'll start at about 10:00.  On average, brewing takes 5 hours +/- discussion period.

While all donations are always appreciated, if you just want to drop in for brewing chitchat and to help stir the brew no donation is needed.
