This weekend (Sunday) is another of foulab's brewing days, and this one will be open to the wider world of brewing enthusiasts and beginners! We'll be doing an examples of simple beer kits and with enough public interest, a more advanced grain brew.  There will be a discussion session and a Q&A. 

We'll start at about 10:00.  On average, brewing takes 5 hours +/- discussion period.

Recommended donation to help cover material costs is 10$ to 20$.
