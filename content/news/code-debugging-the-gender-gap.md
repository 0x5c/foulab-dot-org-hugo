[Code: Debugging the Gender Gap](http://www.codedoc.co/) is a documentary directed by Robin Reynolds which looks at the reasons behind the dearth of women and minorities in programming. Thanks to the generosity of Staci Hartman, one of the producers, Foulab is able to offer a free screening of this film. We encourage you to donate to support their work, details can be found on the [Code documentary website](http://www.codedoc.co/).  
  
Admission is free but an RSVP is necessary because space is pretty tight (20 places). Snacks will be available on site for a small contribution, but you are also welcome to bring your own.
