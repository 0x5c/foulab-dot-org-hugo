Is there anyone who doesn't love machine learning?  
  
  
Perhaps, but they are probably not reading this website anyway!  


In September 2016, [a Deep Learning School was held at Stanford](http://www.bayareadlschool.org/), and they generously posted their lectures online.  Starting in 2017, once a week for 6 weeks we will get together at Foulab to watch and discuss the course presentations.

  
All are welcome to come and simply listen to the lectures, but bringing a laptop and getting into the math after the video is highly encouraged.
  
  
The schedule is subject to adaptation, but currently we plan to watch two lectures per evening, [in the order they were originally presented](http://www.bayareadlschool.org/schedule).  
  
  
__Update:__ Here is a [useful playlist of the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zij_FTbJHsk&list=PLWtzrfzH7gsfxTs8neTRJDXuqAn7qeV4E).

  
Vegetarian chili will be available for a small donation.

Machine learning Wednesdays will start on Jan 11, 2017. To avoid a time conflict with the excellent meetup group [Papers We Love](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/), we will take a break on the last Wednesday of each month. Thus the schedule is 19:00-22:00-Jan 11, Jan 18,  Feb 1, 8, 15, March 1.
