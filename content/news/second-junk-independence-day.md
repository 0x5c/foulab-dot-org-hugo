Foulab is having our second Junk Independence Day, this time in conjunction with our spring cleaning!  
Here's how it works: bring any junk you want to get rid of. Or bring nothing. Then look through the junk pile and take any junk that strikes your fancy! At the end of the day all unclaimed junk WILL BE RECYCLED so don't leave anything behind that think you might want!  

* When: 21-MAR-2015 14-18h
* Where: Foulab
