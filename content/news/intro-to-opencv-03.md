Do you want to make your computer react to light, movement and gestures? Do you want to capture and process images and video as part of your project? Do you wonder: whats wrong with these lazy AI programmers, why can't my computer recognize me yet? Get answers to all these questions and more at the Foulab Workshop “Introduction to computer vision with OpenCV”! [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is an open source library for capturing and analyzing images and video. It is written in C/C++, and API's are available in Python, Java and on Android and iOS.  
  
The workshop is aimed at people with some programming knowledge, but not necessarily any computer vision knowledge. We will cover:  
  
* How to install and set up the Open Computer Vision toolkit (OpenCV),
* An introduction to computer vision algorithms (including image filtering, face detection, segmentation, tracking and stereo vision),
* Code walkthrough and demonstration of OpenCV examples that you can use as starting points for your own projects.  
  
The primary programming language for the workshop will be Python. The workshop has been updated from previous workshops to cover OpenCV 2.4.6, and the latest version of OpenCV's python interface. The workshop presentations will be in English, but we are more than happy to provide support and answer questions in French.

While this workshop will be limited in scope to OpenCV itself, people are encouraged to stay after the workshop and discuss more advanced topics, such as the interfacing of openCV with other libraries and languages. If you have projects in mind or in progress, please do stick around and chat with us!
