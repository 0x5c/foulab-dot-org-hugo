First evening dedicated to design of a PWM (pulse wave modulation) power control module.  
  
Every good hacker sooner or later will require a pulse wave modulated power source. To simplify the project, we will focus on the controller and modulator (MOSFET). The module can then be connected to a power supply of your choice. We are aiming to construct a controller that can handle from 3 to 80 V at frequencies from 10Hz to 50kHz and currents of 20A or more.  
  
When: 12 jan 2015 19h-22h  
Where: Foulab  
  
Everyone who is interested by this project is welcome.
