Ever wondered what mushrooms really are or wanted to learn how to grow them? Fungi are a delicious addition to any meal, and there are so many more edible species than what's available in most stores. Participants will learn about fungi and how to grow them and will go home with a jar of mushroom spawn they prepared themselves which will grow into beautiful mushrooms

Cost is $35 to cover cost of material and to support foulab.
Worshop Duration: 3 hour
