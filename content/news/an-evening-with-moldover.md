In this interactive demonstration, Moldover will present his latest music and instrument creations, including The Robocaster Guitar, the prototype MC1 Voice-Controller, and the Light-Theremin CD packaging from his debut album.  
  
__About the Artist:__  
"A musician at heart, inventor born of curiosity, and innovator by necessity, I believe the world calls him the 'Godfather of Controllerism' for damned good reasons".  
-John Tackett, Crowd Wire  
  
Moldover's collected work is deep, diverse, and nearly impossible to summarize, but its essence shines clearly when you see the artist on stage delivering emotional and authentic performances with hybrid instruments of his own design. Explore his creations further and you'll discover a cultural icon who invents new formats for interactive album artwork, cultivates collaboration by building elaborate jamboxes, and has inspired an entire generation of free-culture music-makers by openly sharing his methods and his madness.
