Software defined radio (SDR) has become easily accessible thanks to the availability of inexpensive "dongles" using the RTL2832U chip. However, after tuning in the local FM station, sometimes it is hard to go further. This meeting brings together people with an interest in SDR to share knowledge and collaborate on projects.If you have SDR equipment, please bring it for show and tell (hence the title). And of course, it doesn't literally have to be an RTL dongle, other radio platforms such as FunCube, HackRF, SoftRock, etc would be great.  
  
Anyone with an interest in software defined radio is welcome. No particular background is required.
