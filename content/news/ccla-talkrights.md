The [Canadian Civil Liberties Association](https://ccla.org/) is gearing up to launch a new online space for the public to learn about their civil liberties. As part of the launch, the CCLA is visiting community organizations, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to build a blueprint for the project's development post-launch.  
The CCLA will be visiting Foulab on __Thursday May 14th from 5:30 — 7:30pm__ for an informal get together — bring a friend, and your ideas about civil liberties in Canada!  

  
What content about civil liberties, rights and freedoms do you feel is currently missing or hard to access? What issues should the CCLA be focusing on in the coming year? Come have a beer and talk about it with Lex Gill and Dr. Brenda McPhail from the CCLA, this Thursday!  


(This main event will be in English, but the Q&A; and discussion afterwards will be bilingual.)
