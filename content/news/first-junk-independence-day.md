Do you have any old electronic junk you want to get rid of? Do you like sorting through piles of old junk for cool stuff? Then you should come to Foulab's Junk Independence Day on Saturday, October 5, 2013, from noon to 5 PM. Drop off any and all electronics you don't want and/or take some cool stuff. __You don't need to leave junk to take junk! Junk is free for all!__  
  
On Tuesday, October 8 at 4 PM, any leftover junk will be taken to the Ecocentre for recycling.
