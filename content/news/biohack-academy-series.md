Today we're announcing the Bio-Hacking Academy Course at Foulab. Once a week for nine weeks we'll be viewing the excellent lecture series put together by Open WetLab and trying experiments and building equipment for ourselves. Each video lasts about 2 hours and the hands on component lasts about an hour.

Recommended donation to cover material costs for the equipment we'll be building is $25.

The class will be held every Friday, starting November 4rth at 6pm.  
See you there!
