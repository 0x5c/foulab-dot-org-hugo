Foulab is having it's annual Christmas party on the December 14th, starting at 20:00.  Themes are great, and we have a small addiction to neon and retro-future stuff so wearing neon and bringing synthwave carols is encouraged.  


-Bringing food is encouraged.

-We are also having a Festivus party, December 14th starting at 20:00 at Foulab, same theme.
