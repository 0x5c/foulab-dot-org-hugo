This wednesdays WIP night will be dedicated to various [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) projects. This is partly to prepare material for the [upcoming Open CV workshop](https://foulab.org/news/double-header-opencv-and-webgl/), but we also have a number of vision based projects on the go. Come by and get a sneak preview of the course, or just chat about computer vision.  
  
Cost: Free, although pass-the-hat style donations to support the lab are encouraged.  
  
Wednesday, Oct. 23, 18:30-22:00  
  
On __Work In Progress Night__ a foulaber brings a work in progress to the lab and works on it for a few hours. Anyone interested can drop in to check it out and discuss the project, receive or give advice, or bring a similar project and work on it. There is no promise that anything will actually work, but it should be fun!!!
