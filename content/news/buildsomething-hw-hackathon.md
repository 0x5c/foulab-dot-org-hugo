It's a "hackathon" where you get to build something awesome in one day. Your project will get reviewed by a panel of judges and there will be prizes from sponsors in several categories.  
  
There is no category limit as long as its a hardware build. You can come as a team or try to join a team on the day of the event. You can and should bring all necessary parts and extras which are prepared ahead of time but the project must be built on the day of the hackathon.  
  
The following tools will be available for you to use (with assistance of a pro if necessary):  
  
    3d Printers
    CNC Machine
    Soldering Station
    Oscilloscope, multimeters, microscope  
  
True hackers will just come with a box of electro junk and build an awesome prototype during the day. More info at [Build Something](http://buildsomething.ca/)
