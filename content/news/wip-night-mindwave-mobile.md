Supposedly, the [Neurosky Mindwave Mobile](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile) has a fairly flexible developer API. I've got a Mindwave. It's time to try it out.

On Work In Progress Night a foulaber brings a work in progress to the lab and works on it for a few hours. Anyone interested can drop in to check it out and discuss the project, receive or give advice, or bring a similar project and work on it. There is no promise that anything will actually work, but it should be fun!!!
