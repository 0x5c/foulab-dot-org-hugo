The coming weekend brings another of foulab's brewing days, and we are happy to welcome everyone from experienced brewing enthusiasts to complete beginners! We'll be doing a all grain brew this time.  With enough public interest, we can do a formal workshop complete with notes and presentation.  Alternately we can use the stand around the brew pot and chitchat learning method. 

We'll start at about 10:00.  On average, brewing takes 5 hours +/- discussion period.

For those who would like a formal presentation and notes, recommended donation to help cover material costs is 10$ to 20$.  While all donations are always appreciated, if you just want to drop in for brewing chitchat and to help stir the brew no donation is needed.
