This is an introductory, hands-on workshop for absolute begginers. We will start with an introduction to python, and work our way up by learning and applying basic programming concepts until we are able to make our own auto-correct program as an example.

Please bring your own laptop and install Python 3.6.5 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/. No programming experience required!
