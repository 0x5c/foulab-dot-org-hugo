Goals:  
We will learn how to reverse engineer a basic buffer overflow vulnerability.  
Part of this will be an introduction to fuzzing for the vulnerability, followed by how to write a piece of  
modern exploit code that will work around Address Space Layout Randomization and Write/Execute Exclusion.  
  
This will be a Windows10 focused tutorial.  
  
Bringing your own laptop with Win10 installed in some fashion is required.  
  
More advanced techniques will be seen as time permits.  
  
  
Subjects covered:  

* Setting up x64dbg on windows, and navigating a basic binary.
* Integrating this with unicorn engine.
* OS end execution model for Win10 overview.
* Exploit code and shellcode development.
* Basic fuzzing of input through hooking the binary using unicorn engine.
* Stretch goal: if time permits, we will leverage Z3 based SMT solvers to fuzz.
  
  
This is an **advanced** course.  
  
8 hours has been assigned to the block with an hour for lunch. Finishing at 18:00.  
Knowledge of at least python scripting as well as the basics of computer science is required.  
  
**A 25$ donation at the door is strongly encourged to support FOULAB.**
