## Hugo version

This site is currently confirmed to work with Hugo **v0.40** (released May 2018), and that's what the production server runs, so it is recommended to use this version. See [precompiled binaries on Github](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.40.3).

Mac OS 13.5 can *not* run the precompiled binaries. Golang 1.20.3 can *not* build Hugo v0.40 from source.

The site generates incorrectly under Hugo v0.116 (August 2023) (some missing content on home page).
